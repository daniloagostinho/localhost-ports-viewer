## [0.0.18] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Framework detection via `package.json`** — replaces unreliable `ls node_modules`; now reads actual `dependencies` + `devDependencies` for accurate identification
- Detects **Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Svelte, Remix, Astro, Fastify, Koa, Hapi, Hono, Elysia, Webpack**
- Detects **Spring Boot, Laravel, Rails, Django, FastAPI, Flask, Nginx, Apache, Go, Ruby**
- **Copy port** and **Copy URL** actions per row (clipboard, with ✓ feedback)
- **Kill process** action with confirmation dialog before terminating
- **Search bar** — live filter by port number or service name
- **Quick filter tabs** — All / Node / DB / Web / Other
- **Favorites** — star any port to pin it to the top; persists across restarts
- **Scroll preservation** — auto-refresh no longer jumps the scroll position
- **Loading spinner** overlay during refresh
- **Empty state** with Refresh button when no ports are detected
- **Error state** with "Try again" button on detection failure
- `openBrowserTarget` setting — choose between system browser and VS Code Simple Browser
- Native VS Code CSS variables throughout — works on dark, light, and high-contrast themes
- Activity bar icon switched to SVG for correct rendering

### Changed
- Port list now uses `postMessage` architecture instead of full HTML replacement on each refresh
- Service labels now show framework name directly (e.g. "React" instead of "React (Node.js)")
- Brand colors added for all detected frameworks/services
- Favorites appear at the top of the list, sorted by port number

### Fixed
- React projects being detected as Express when `express` appeared in transitive dependencies
- Activity bar icon appearing as a broken grey square

---

## [0.0.17] — 2025-xx-xx

### Added
- Anti-concurrent refresh (ignores new cycles while one is already running)
- PID cache with 15s TTL to reduce redundant OS calls
- Content Security Policy on the webview
- HTML escaping for all rendered process/framework names
- Configurable `refreshInterval` and `commandTimeout` via settings
- Optional `debugLogs` setting for verbose output in the Output panel
- Port validation before opening URLs

### Changed
- Windows: replaced `wmic` with PowerShell `Get-NetTCPConnection + Get-Process`
- Linux: prioritizes `ss -lntp` with `lsof` fallback
- macOS: standardized parser for `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n`
- Architecture split into OS-specific providers

---

### Added
